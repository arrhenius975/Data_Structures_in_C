# Data Structures in C

## Overview
This repository provides a detailed guide to essential data structures with:
- Theoretical insights.
- Mathematical interludes.
- Practical C implementations.

The notes cover Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Expression Evaluations (Infix, Prefix, Postfix). Itâ€™s an excellent resource for both learning and interview preparation.
